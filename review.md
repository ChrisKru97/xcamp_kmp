I want you to prepare a plan - where you select every file from the project - first kotlin shared code and then ios swift code and go one by one making a code review for it.
Go only one file at a time! Never take more then one file for the review.
During the code review, look for any problems, leaks. COmpare the logic with the industry standard. Make sure it is stable, up to date, uses modern API. Make sure it is simple and doesn't repeat itself anywhere else. DOnt hesitate to use skills to review it.
After doing the code review of the file - make sure you resolve all the problems and implement all the recommended changes. Dont forget about anything, be thorough.
So e.g. i have files 1,2,3 and this is the expected plan:
${Info about how to do the review}
Steps:
1. Review "file 1"
2. Apply the changes from review to "file 1"
3. Review "file 2"
4. Apply the changes from review to "file 2"
5. Review "file 3"
6. Apply the changes from review to "file 3"
