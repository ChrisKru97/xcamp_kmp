Make sure the ios app is connected and fetching correct firestore data. You can be inspired by the setup in ~/Documents/xcamp_app
Namely I mean speakers and places collection. Don't finish until you see the real data (i have some of them in my firestore project) on the ios simulator!!!
Make sure to not alter anyhow the database itself!!!! IT IS READ-ONLY
