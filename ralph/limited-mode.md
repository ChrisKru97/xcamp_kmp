I want you to understand the limited mode of the app and plan how to implement it properly - the shared logic and both UI implementations (kotlin, ios)
The source of truth or inspiration is to be taken from flutter project located in ~/Documents/xcamp_app - make sure you keep all the data/info and functionality that is in the limited mode in flutter project (home, media and info tab)
The design should be modern, minimalistic, and aligning to latest design standards for each system (ios 26 - liquid glass, android 16 - material ui 3)
